Welcome to Alx/Holberton School of Engineering DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Interview preparation repository!
In this repository, you will find a variety of problems and solutions related to data structures and algorithms. Each problem is accompanied by a description of the problem, as well as a solution in the form of code in Python programming languages.

I am constantly adding new problems and solutions to this repository, so be sure to check back often.
I hope that this repository can be a helpful resource for anyone looking to improve their skills in data structures and algorithms. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, I believe there is always something new to learn and practice in this field.
Some of the problems and solutions solved include:
Pascal's Algorithm: This is a well-known algorithm for generating the elements of a Pascal's Triangle. I have implemented this algorithm in Python, and provided a thorough explanation of the code.

Lockboxes: This is a problem where you are given a list of lockboxes, each with a secret integer code. Your task is to find the minimum number of boxes you need to open in order to find the codes for all of the boxes. I have provided a solution to this problem in Python, including an example of how to test the code.
